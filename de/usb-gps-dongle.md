If you don't have any GPS on board or you want an extra positioning device, this is the cheapest and most effective way.

Connecting an USB GPS dongle to OpenPlotter will provide accurate position, date/time and speed/course over ground.

## Settings

See [NMEA 0183](/nmea-0183.md) chapter to configure USB GPS dongles.
