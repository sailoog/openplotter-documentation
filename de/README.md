There are people who buy boats but there are also people who build them, why not build your own electronics too? OpenPlotter is a combination of software and hardware to be used as navigational aid on small and medium boats. It is also a complete home automation system onboard. It works on ARM computers like the Raspberry Pi[[1]](https://www.raspberrypi.org) and is open-source, low-cost and low-consumption. Its design is modular, so you just have to implement what your boat needs. Do it yourself.

## Features

* **SDR-AIS**. Receive and decode AIS with cheap DVB-T dongles. Calibration tools Included.
* **NMEA 0183**. Receive, filter, multiplex and send NMEA data through serial and network inputs and outputs.
* **NMEA 2000**. Connect an USB adapter to your N2K network to receive and send data.
* **Signal K Server**[[4]](http://signalk.org). Convert data from sensors to Signal K and exchange data between all formats.
* **WiFi Access Point**. Share NMEA and Signal K data with laptops, tablets and phones.
* **Headless**. Access to OpenPlotter desktop from the cockpit through your mobile devices.
* **Dashboards**. Build instrument panels to visualize data from your mobile devices.
