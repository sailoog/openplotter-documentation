# USB DVB-T dongle

![](sdr.png)

DVB-T dongles based on the Realtek **RTL2832U** chip can be used as cheap one channel AIS receptors. You can also receive the entire VHF marine band.

These devices are called Software Defined Radio (SDR) receivers.

SDR receivers will need more power than the Raspberry Pi USB port can provide. You need to plug the dongle into a self powered USB hub.

##Antenna

The most important factor for good reception is the antenna. Any VHF antenna will work right. You can build some proficient homemade antennas[[1]](http://www.radioforeveryone.com/p/ais-antennas.html)[[2]](http://nmearouter.com/docs/ais/aerial.html)[[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdEglNHyHB4).



## Settings

Some SDR devices need calibration to receive AIS signal. See [SDR receiver](/sdr-receiver.md) chapter to configure USB DVB-T dongles as AIS or marine radio receivers.
