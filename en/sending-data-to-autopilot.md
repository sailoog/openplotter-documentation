Most autopilots have there own fluxgate compass and rudder angle sensor. These data can be used from OpenPlotter.

out Filter: What sentences are allowed to be send from OpenPlotter/kplex to the autopilot.

It is important to filter the sentences to reduce the transfer volume. NMEA0183 autopilots work normally with 4800 bauds. There's only space for a few sentences.

Which sentences are important?

* RMB \(way to selected waypoint send from a chartplotter\)

* RMC \(minimum GPS data\)

* VHW \(waterspeed and heading\)

* VWR \(wind\)

* sometimes APA and APB
